I am trying to rewrite the /Users/eugeneleychenko/Downloads/atVenu-Forcasting/Brady Project/stream_all_products_for_upcoming_show.py file, because it does not natively pull the attendence, which comes from https://atvenu-forecast.votintsev.com/tour_data.csv, which has these column headings:

Band	Show Date	City	ST	Venue	Nights	Type	Capacity	Attn	$/Head		Gross		Show Costs		Net Receipts

and also i want to be able to pull price for products from /Users/eugeneleychenko/Downloads/atVenu-Forcasting/Brady Project/band_sku_price_data.csv.
